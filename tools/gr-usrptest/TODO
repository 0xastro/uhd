    - USRP 1: send tone from first to second daughterboard - delta_phi_1
    - USRP 1: send tone from second daughterboard to USPR 2 - delta_phi_2
    - USRP 2: send tone to first daughterboard (USRP1) - delta_phi_3
    
    Arbitrary number of RX-USRPs and TX-USRPs possible.

    test_signal = sin(2*pi*f*t + phi)
    reference = sin(2*pi*f*t)
